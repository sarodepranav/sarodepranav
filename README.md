- 👋 Hi, I’m a variable Pranav assigned to a set that includes elements such as diligence, perseverance and prudence. Certain functions demand only a certain set of elements and not the entire universal set. My set of elements is such that the return value of the condition is always true. This condition of the function eliminates probability of redundancies and deadlocks. But the insatiable greed and need to improvise the function is never satisfied and that, is directly proportional to the development of the program. This is when a new variable like me, having distinct elements, is explicitly used giving a different but vaunted edge to the program.

- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Networking, Music Production, Singing :)
